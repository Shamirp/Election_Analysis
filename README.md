# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit 
This election audit provides an analysis of each candidate and counties results based on votes. The Election Results analysis provides a total vote count and which candidate and county received what portion of that total number of votes.

This script can be modified to provide election results to any election. The csv file format plays a role in the code that was formed to produce these results. If the csv file is in the same format as the election_results.csv file, then no changes would have to be made to the script. If the file is in a different format, we must ensure the row where the candidate and county is update into the script as described in the two rows of code above. This essentially aligns the script of code to evaluate the proper columns of data from the csv file.
